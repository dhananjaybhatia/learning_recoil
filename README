Recoil State Management with React and Backend Integration

Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Recoil for state management in a React application. Recoil simplifies state management by introducing atoms (shared state) and selectors (derived state), enabling efficient and reactive UI updates.

In this setup:

We manage different pieces of application state like network, jobs, messaging, and notifications using Recoil atoms.
A Recoil selector computes the total value by aggregating multiple atom states.
Additionally, the data for atoms in atom2.js comes from a backend API, making the state dynamic and real-world relevant.

Technologies Used

React: Frontend library for building UI components.
Recoil: State management for React applications.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to fetch data from the backend.
Node.js: Backend API for dynamic state values (mocked).
